# LotterAdmin

User Story: As a lottery administrator, I want an interface so that I can easily buy tickets on behalf of my customers and
administrate the winnings.




A Few Assumptions Made with this Project:

1. Customer can have from 1 to arbitrary amount of Names.
2. We purchase only 1 ticket at a time
3. Names may contain numbers / Name is not the identifier, the ticket number as and hence any value to go with it suffices.
4. Names must be longer than a character
